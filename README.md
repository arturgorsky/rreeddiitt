Redit like clone build with React, GraphQL and TypeScript
The purpose of this app is not to offer 100% complete Reddit funcitonality, but rather to be example project setup of technologies i want to use and build upon

Tools and technologies used:
* NPM
* GIT
* Typescript


## How to run
1) Use npm init
2) I used yarn watch to compile .ts files into .js files. It creates dist folder with compiled javascript
3) Yarn start runs node under dist/index.js
